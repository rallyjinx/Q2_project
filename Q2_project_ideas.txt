My project is an app that allows people to post their abandoned/unfinished project ideas 
for someone else to find and complete. If someone has an idea that they know they'll never 
complete, they can log in and post the idea. Then if someone else is looking for a project
they can log in and search other people's ideas. If a project has been started and there 
are any materials to be transfered, there will be contact info for the poster. Projects 
will be searchable by topic or you can ask for a random idea.
